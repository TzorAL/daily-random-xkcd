            <p>[<a href="https://xkcd.com/2101/">#2101</a>] "I [suspect] that we are throwing more and more of our resources, including the cream of our youth, into financial activities remote from the production of goods and services, into activities that generate high private rewards disproportionate to their social productivity.

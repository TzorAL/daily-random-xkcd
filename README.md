# üé≤ Daily Random xkcd üé≤

## üìñ About
This repository **automatically generates a daily random xkcd comic** and serves it as an **RSS feed**. Each day, a new comic is fetched, formatted, and made available for subscription. Users can configure **RSS.app** to send email notifications whenever a new comic is available in the feed. It also features a fun xkcd-themed 404 error page that showcases a random comic in a playful layout.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
1. üïî **Daily Trigger**: A GitHub Actions workflow is triggered every day at **8:00 AM UTC+3** to run a Python script (`generate_rss.py`).
2. üì• **Random Comic Fetch**: The script fetches a random comic from the xkcd API, ensuring it hasn't been seen before.
3. üìù **XML Generation**: Comic details are formatted as XML and saved to `docs/xkcd_feed.xml`.
4. üóÇÔ∏è **Seen Comics Tracking**: The comics are tracked in `seen_comics.json` to avoid repeats.
5. üöÄ **RSS Hosting**: The RSS feed is hosted on GitHub for easy access by RSS.app.
6. üìß **Email Notifications**: RSS.app monitors the feed and sends email alerts when a new comic is available.
7. üí° **404 Page**: A Python script generates an xkcd-themed 404 page with a random comic.

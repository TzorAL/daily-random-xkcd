# Daily Random xkcd RSS Feed

This repository generates a daily RSS feed that provides a random xkcd comic. The feed updates automatically each day via GitHub Actions, making it easy to integrate with IFTTT to receive daily emails with a random xkcd comic.

## Features

- Generates a random xkcd comic every day.
- Automatically updates the RSS feed (`xkcd_feed.xml`) via GitHub Actions.
- Can be connected to IFTTT to receive daily email notifications with the latest comic.

## How It Works

1. **GitHub Actions**:
   - A scheduled workflow runs every day at midnight UTC.
   - The workflow picks a random xkcd comic and updates the `xkcd_feed.xml` file.
   - The feed contains details like the comic title, image, alt text, and a link to the comic.

2. **RSS Feed**:
   - The generated feed is located at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repo-name>/xkcd_feed.xml`.
   - This feed can be used with IFTTT or any RSS reader.

3. **IFTTT Integration**:
   - You can use IFTTTâ€™s "New feed item" trigger to send yourself an email every time the feed updates with a new xkcd comic.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Fork or Clone this Repository

Fork this repository to your own GitHub account or clone it locally.

### 2. Modify the `main.yaml` Workflow

Ensure that the GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/main.yaml`) is configured with your preferences. The default setup runs daily at midnight UTC.

### 3. RSS Feed Generation

The script `generate_rss.py` fetches a random xkcd comic using the xkcd API and generates an RSS feed.

The RSS feed includes:
- Comic title.
- Comic image.
- Comic alt text (hover text).
- A link to the comic.

### 4. Set Up IFTTT

1. Go to [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/).
2. Create a new applet.
3. Select the "RSS Feed" trigger and choose "New feed item".
4. Use the URL of your RSS feed: `https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repo-name>/xkcd_feed.xml`.
5. Set the action to send an email with the comic details (or any other action you'd prefer).
6. Save the applet. Now you will receive a daily email with a random xkcd comic!

### 5. Run Locally (Optional)

To run the script locally:

1. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install requests
    ```

2. Run the script:

    ```bash
    python generate_rss.py
    ```

### 6. Check the Status

You can view the status of the daily GitHub Actions workflow in the "Actions" tab of your repository. This will show you whether the feed is being updated successfully each day.
